Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data focusing on cases, deaths, and vaccinations across selected countries. It provides insights through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations using Python.

Objectives
- Import and clean global COVID-19 data.
- Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.
- Compare key metrics between Kenya, USA, and India.
- Visualize trends with charts and maps.
- Summarize findings in a clear, insightful report.

Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Insights and Reflections
1. The USA showed the highest number of cases and vaccinations, followed by India and Kenya.

2. Vaccination rollout rates vary greatly and highlight global inequities.

3. Data cleaning and forward-filling missing data was crucial for accurate trend analysis.

4. Visualizing data helped identify key waves and vaccination progress.
